# Usage :joystick:

Please create a new `.env` file from `.env.example` file.

Eg:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM =
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL =
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN =
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID =
GMAIL_PASSKEY =
EMAIL_ADDRESS =
```

### Then, Customize data in the `utils/data` [folder](https://github.com/said7388/developer-portfolio/tree/main/utils/data).

Eg:

```javascript
export const personalData = {
  name: "Aravind Balineni",
  profile: "/profile.png",
  designation: "Automation Technical Lead",
  description: "Aravind Balineni is an Automation Technical Lead with extensive experience in RPA implementation and Python integration. He has a proven track record of innovation, solution consulting, and transforming traditional SDLC processes to Agile. Aravind excels in customer engagement and people management, building and guiding high-performing teams.",
  email: "****@***.***",
  phone: "********",
  address: "Hyderabad",
  github: "https://github.com/arwin1109",
  facebook: "",
  linkedIn: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/?????/",
  twitter: "",
  stackOverflow: "",
  leetcode: "",
  devUsername: "",
  resume: "documents/Resume.pdf",
};
```

`devUsername` is used for fetching blog posts from `dev.to`.

# FAQ:

1. For those facing the issue of "`next` is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."

Run the following command:

```bash

npm install -g next

```

This installs Next.js globally

then do the usual `npm run dev`
